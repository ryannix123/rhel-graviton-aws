## **üõ† How to Use This Playbook**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites**
Before running this playbook, ensure you have:
- **Ansible** installed on your local machine
- **AWS CLI** configured with appropriate IAM permissions
- **A Red Hat Subscription** for registering RHEL instances

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up AWS IAM Permissions**

This deployment requires specific AWS IAM permissions. For your convenience, two playbooks are included to manage these permissions:

#### Creating the Required IAM User

Run the provided IAM user creation playbook:

```bash
ansible-playbook create-iam-user.yml
```

This playbook will:
- Create an IAM policy based on `rhel-graviton-policy.json`
- Create a new IAM user (`rhel-graviton-deployer`)
- Attach the policy to the user
- Create access keys for the user
- Configure the AWS CLI with a new profile
- Save credentials to a backup file and display them

The output will show the new user's credentials and explain how to use the profile.

#### Using the IAM User

After running the creation playbook:

1. **Set the AWS Profile for Your Deployment**

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=rhel-graviton-deployer
```

2. **Verify Access**

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

You should see output showing the `rhel-graviton-deployer` user and your AWS account ID.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Update Your Variables**
Modify the `vars` section of `deploy_rhel9_graviton.yml` to include your own:
- **AWS Region & Credentials**
- **SSH Key & Trusted IP for Access**
- **Red Hat Subscription Manager (RHSM) Username, Password, and Pool ID**
- **Container Registry Credentials & Application Details**

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Playbook**
Execute the playbook with:
```bash
# Standard execution
ansible-playbook deploy_rhel9_graviton.yml

# For EC2 deployments, disable host key checking to avoid SSH connection issues
ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False ansible-playbook deploy_rhel9_graviton.yml
```

The `ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False` option is especially important when deploying to newly created EC2 instances, as it prevents Ansible from getting stuck waiting for SSH host key confirmation. This happens because EC2 instances get new host keys every time they're created, which would normally trigger a security warning.

You can also make this permanent for AWS deployments by adding to your ansible.cfg:
```ini
[defaults]
host_key_checking = False
```

Or by setting in your environment:
```bash
export ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
```

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Access Your Application**
Once complete, the playbook will output a **Load Balancer DNS URL**:
```bash
Access your application at https://rhel9-load-balancer-123456789.elb.amazonaws.com
```
Open this URL in your browser ‚Äì **no SSL errors, fully encrypted!** üîí

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Cleanup When Finished**

When you're done with your deployment, you can clean everything up with these provided playbooks:

#### Clean Up AWS Infrastructure

```bash
# Using state file (recommended - more reliable resource tracking)
ansible-playbook cleanup-playbook.yml -e @rhel9-graviton-state-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS.json

# Or traditional method (less reliable but works if you've lost the state file)
ansible-playbook cleanup-playbook.yml
```

The improved cleanup playbook:
- Uses the state file to directly target resources for deletion
- Queries AWS Systems Manager Parameters for backup resource information
- Deletes resources in the proper dependency order
- Handles complex dependencies like network interfaces
- Provides detailed debugging information
- Verifies complete removal of all resources
- Cleans up state files and local SSH keys

#### Clean Up IAM User

When you're finished with the IAM user created for this deployment:

```bash
# Remove the IAM user and policy
ansible-playbook cleanup-iam-user.yml
```

This playbook will:
- Delete all access keys for the IAM user
- Detach policies from the user
- Delete the IAM user and policy
- Remove the AWS CLI profile configuration
- Delete the credentials backup file

## **Why Ansible Excels for Cross-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud Deployments**

Ansible provides unique advantages for organizations managing hybrid and multi-cloud environments:

**True Infrastructure-as-Code Without Lock-in**: Unlike CloudFormation (AWS-only) or Azure Resource Manager templates, Ansible works consistently across AWS, GCP, Azure, Oracle Cloud, and on-premises infrastructure, allowing you to standardize automation regardless of where workloads run.

**Single Control Point for Everything**: Ansible doesn't just configure cloud resources - it seamlessly extends to network devices (Cisco, Juniper, Arista), storage systems (NetApp, Pure), security appliances, and even IoT devices. This creates a unified automation framework spanning your entire technology estate.

**Workflow Orchestration Across Boundaries**: A single Ansible playbook can provision cloud resources, configure on-premises networking, update database schemas, and manage container platforms - eliminating integration gaps between specialized tools.

**Progressive Automation Adoption**: Teams can start with simple tasks and gradually expand automation coverage without wholesale replacements of existing systems - ideal for enterprises with mixed traditional and cloud-native environments.

**Human-Readable Syntax**: YAML-based playbooks are accessible to operations teams without specialized programming skills, lowering the barriers to automation adoption across your organization.

**Red Hat's Enterprise Support**: For production environments, Ansible Automation Platform provides the certified content, role-based access controls, and support SLAs that enterprises require for mission-critical automation.

In essence, Ansible lets you write once and deploy anywhere, treating everything from legacy mainframes to cutting-edge cloud services as part of a cohesive automation strategy.
